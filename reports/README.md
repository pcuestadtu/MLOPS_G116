# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

`![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)`

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

or

```bash
uv add typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

*We made use of both branches and pull requests (PRs) in our project. Each group member worked on their own branch. On the remote repository, we had four branches (main and three personal branches), while locally each member had two branches (main and their personal branch). When it was time to upload changes, we added, committed, and pushed the personal branch. After GitHub Actions passed all tests, we opened a pull request to merge the personal branch into main. Once the tests passed again, we authorized the merge and pulled main locally. Pull requests helped improve version control by enforcing code reviews and automated testing before any changes were merged into the main branch. This ensured that new features or fixes were validated, reduced the risk of introducing errors, and maintained a clear and traceable history of changes. This workflow allowed us to resolve issues without affecting the protected main branch.*


### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:


*We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*

> Answer:

*Yes, we used DVC to manage the data in our project. DVC allowed us to version control large datasets without storing them directly in Git, which would have been inefficient and impractical given the size of the data. By storing the raw dataset in a cloud storage bucket and tracking it through DVC, we were able to maintain a clear and reproducible link between specific versions of the data and the corresponding versions of the code. This improved the reliability and reproducibility of the project, as each experiment or model could be traced back to the exact dataset used. Additionally, DVC enabled efficient collaboration among team members by allowing quick and consistent data synchronization using commands such as -dvc pull-. This ensured that all contributors worked with the same data version, reduced inconsistencies across environments, and simplified the setup process when cloning the repository. Overall, using DVC significantly improved data versioning, reproducibility, and collaboration within the project.*


### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.

## Working in the cloud

> In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.

### Question 17

> **List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

*We used the following two services: Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, Cloud Run, Compute Engine, Vertex AI and Cloud Storage (Bucket).
Cloud Build is for building the images (via trigger) and pushing them to the Artifact Registry, where the containers are stored and CLoud Run runns them. Engine and Vertex AI are used to train the models (using CPU to increase the speed). Bucket is used to store the dataset in the cloud.*

### Question 18

> **The backbone of GCP is the Compute engine. Explained how you made use of this service and what type of VMs**
> **you used?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the compute engine to run our ... . We used instances with the following hardware: ... and we started the*
> *using a custom container: ...*
>
> Answer:

> *We used Compute Engine, which is the backbone of Google Cloud Platform, to run virtual machines for training our models. Specifically, we used e2-medium instances with 2 virtual CPUs and 4 GB of memory, running on x86‑64 architecture.We started these virtual machines using a custom container that included all the dependencies and code necessary for our project. This setup allowed us to have a reproducible environment for training, ensuring that all team members could run the same workloads consistently. Compute Engine gave us the flexibility to choose the VM type and resources based on our project requirements and to scale the environment as needed.*

### Question 19

> **Insert 1-2 images of your GCP bucket, such that we can see what data you have stored in it.**
> **You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/bucket.png).**
>
> Answer:

### Question 20

> **Upload 1-2 images of your GCP artifact registry, such that we can see the different docker images that you have**
> **stored. You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/registry.png).**
>
> Answer:

![Artifact](figures/artifact_screenshot.png)

### Question 21

> **Upload 1-2 images of your GCP cloud build history, so we can see the history of the images that have been build in**
> **your project. You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/build.png).**
>
> Answer:

![Cloud Build](figures/build_screenshot.png)

### Question 22

> **Did you manage to train your model in the cloud using either the Engine or Vertex AI? If yes, explain how you did**
> **it. If not, describe why.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We managed to train our model in the cloud using the Engine. We did this by ... . The reason we choose the Engine*
> *was because ...*
>
> Answer:

*We managed to train our model in the cloud using Vertex AI. To do this, we created an actionable trigger (vertex_ai_train.yaml) that could be executed manually from Google Cloud Build. Once the container was pushed to the Artifact Registry, we started training our model. We chose Vertex AI over using a Compute Engine because Vertex AI provides a higher-level, managed environment specifically designed for machine learning workflows. It simplifies tasks such as resource provisioning, scaling, experiment tracking and monitoring. Unlike Compute Engine, where we would have had to manually configure virtual machines, install dependencies, and manage GPU resources, Vertex AI allowed us to train models quickly and reliably with minimal setup. This made the training process faster, less error-prone, and easier to reproduce, which was particularly beneficial for our team workflow.*

## Deployment

### Question 23

> **Did you manage to write an API for your model? If yes, explain how you did it and if you did anything special. If**
> **not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did manage to write an API for our model. We used FastAPI to do this. We did this by ... . We also added ...*
> *to the API to make it more ...*
>
> Answer:

*We developed an API for our model using FastAPI. The API consists of a root endpoint to test if the service is running and a /classify endpoint that takes in an image and returns the predictions of the best-performing trained model saved in models/model.pth. We implemented an async lifespan for the API (using app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)) to separate initialization from inference. This ensures that the model is loaded only once when the application starts, improving performance for subsequent requests.*


### Question 24

> **Did you manage to deploy your API, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and**
> **preferably how you invoke your deployed service?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For deployment we wrapped our model into application using ... . We first tried locally serving the model, which*
> *worked. Afterwards we deployed it in the cloud, using ... . To invoke the service an user would call*
> *`curl -X POST -F "file=@file.json"<weburl>`*
>
> Answer:

*We successfully deployed our API both locally (running it via the command line and containerized with docker run) and in the cloud using Google Cloud Run. To deploy to the cloud, we created a Dockerfile (backend.dockerfile) that sets up the necessary environment and dependencies. After building the Docker image, we tagged and pushed it to Google Cloud Artifact Registry. Then, we deployed the image to Cloud Run, configuring the service with unauthenticated access and assigning it sufficient memory resources (2GB). Cloud Run automatically provided a public URL for our API. To invoke the deployed API, you can run the following command: `curl -X POST "https://backend-277552599633.europe-west1.run.app/classify/"   -H "accept: application/json"   -F "file=@path_to_image.jpg;type=image/jpeg"`. Additonally, we set up continuous deployment using Google Cloud Build with the `cloudbuild.yaml`, which automatically builds and deploys the Docker image whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of our GitHub repository.*

### Question 25

> **Did you perform any unit testing and load testing of your API? If yes, explain how you did it and what results for**
> **the load testing did you get. If not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For unit testing we used ... and for load testing we used ... . The results of the load testing showed that ...*
> *before the service crashed.*
>
> Answer:

*We implemented integration tests with Pytest that test how different components (FastAPI, PyTorch model, file handling) work together in the API. The tests verify the API is alive and reachable and validate the full machine learning inference pipeline: they confirm the loading of the PyTorch model, weights, and transforms into memory without crashing, test if the API accepts standard file uploads, verify that the model actually runs on the input and produces an output, and check that the output JSON contains the correct keys and returns exactly 4 classes. For load testing, we created a locustfile that simulates sending POST requests with image files to the /classify endpoint. We tested three scenarios: 1, 5, and 20 concurrent users. While performance remained stable at 1 and 5 users with no latency degradation, at 20 users, the system reached 7.0 RPS and began failing (resulting in 3 dropped requests and significantly increased latency). In conclusion, our current Cloud Run deployment (1 CPU, 2GB RAM) supports relatively low traffic volumes. To increase capacity, we could increase the number of CPUs assigned to the service and, consequently, the number of workers running the API to utilize those CPUs.*


### Question 26

> **Did you manage to implement monitoring of your deployed model? If yes, explain how it works. If not, explain how**
> **monitoring would help the longevity of your application.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did not manage to implement monitoring. We would like to have monitoring implemented such that over time we could*
> *measure ... and ... that would inform us about this ... behaviour of our application.*
>
> Answer:

*We did not manage to implement monitoring for our deployed model. However, implementing monitoring would be important for ensuring the reliability of our application. Monitoring would allow us to track key performance metrics such as response times, error rates, and system resource usage (CPU, memory). These metrics would help us identify potential bottlenecks or failures in the system. For our project, target drift is a more practical strategy than data drift. While detecting drift in images requires complex, resource-heavy feature extraction, target drift simply analyzes the model's outputs. Any significant shift in the distribution of predicted classes could serve as an indicator of potential model failure.*

## Overall discussion of project

> In the following section we would like you to think about the general structure of your project.

### Question 27

> **How many credits did you end up using during the project and what service was most expensive? In general what do**
> **you think about working in the cloud?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Group member 1 used ..., Group member 2 used ..., in total ... credits was spend during development. The service*
> *costing the most was ... due to ... . Working in the cloud was ...*
>
> Answer:

*In total, we used kr130 out of kr8,237 available for our project. The most expensive service was Container Registry Vulnerability Scanning, which cost kr104, followed by Vertex AI and Cloud Run, each costing kr6, and Compute Engine and Artifact Registry, each costing kr4. Overall, working in the cloud was a very positive experience. It provided scalability, flexibility, and easy access to powerful computing resources without the need to maintain physical hardware. Services like Vertex AI and Cloud Run simplified deployment, automated resource management and allowed us to focus on developing and testing our model rather than managing infrastructure. However, there are some drawbacks. Cloud costs can increase quickly if resources are not managed carefully and understanding all the services and their configurations can be overwhelming at first. Despite these challenges, the advantages of speed, reproducibility, collaboration and low maintenance made cloud computing an excellent choice for our project.*

### Question 28

> **Did you implement anything extra in your project that is not covered by other questions? Maybe you implemented**
> **a frontend for your API, use extra version control features, a drift detection service, a kubernetes cluster etc.**
> **If yes, explain what you did and why.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 0-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We implemented a frontend for our API. We did this because we wanted to show the user ... . The frontend was*
> *implemented using ...*
>
> Answer:

*We implemented a frontend for our API using Streamlit. The frontend allows users to easily upload images and view the model's predictions in a user-friendly interface.  Users can upload an image, and upon submission, the frontend sends the image to the backend API (classify endpoint) for classification. The predictions are then displayed on the same page, providing immediate feedback to the user. The frontend is also containerized and deployed in Google Cloud Run and is publicly accessible in https://frontend-277552599633.europe-west1.run.app.*

### Question 29

> **Include a figure that describes the overall architecture of your system and what services that you make use of.**
> **You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/overview.png). Additionally, in your own words, explain the**

> *Whenever we commit code and push to GitHub, it auto triggers ... and ... . From there the diagram shows ...*
>
> Answer:

![Pipeline](figures/pipeline.png)

*We implemented a CI/CD pipeline with the `cloudbuild.yaml` file that automatically triggers builds and deployments whenever we do a push in the main branch of the GitHub repository. The Cloud Build service builds and pushes the Docker images to Google Cloud Artifact Registry and then it deploys the backend and frontend images to Google Cloud Run, making them publicly accessible.*

TO DO: completaaar(feel free de borrar el que vulgueu)
*One of the main problems was setting up the CI/CD pipeline. We encountered several issues with permissions, authentication and configurations in Google Cloud Build and Cloud Run.
During deployment of frontend and backend services to Cloud Run, we faced challenges related to memory allocation and service accessibility. Initially, the backend service was allocated only 512MB of memory, which proved insufficient for loading the machine learning model, leading to crashes. We resolved this by increasing the memory allocation to 2GB, ensuring stable operation.*
