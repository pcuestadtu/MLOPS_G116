# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

`![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)`

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

or

```bash
uv add typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.
The parenthesis at the end indicates what module the bullet point is related to. Please be honest in your answers, we
will check the repositories and the code to verify your answers.

>
> Answer:

>Group 116

### Question 2
> **Enter the study number for each member in the group**
>
> Example:
>
> *sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX*
>
> Answer:

> s254311, s253742, s253749

### Question 3
> **Did you end up using any open-source frameworks/packages not covered in the course during your project? If so**
> **which did you use and how did they help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 0-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

> No. We did not use open-source frameworks or packages outside the course syllabus. The tools covered in the  course already provided everything we needed for data versioning, experimentation, deployment, testing, and monitoring, so we did not add any external frameworks beyond those.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

>We used Conda to manage all our project dependencies and ensure that the development environment is consistent across different machines. The list of dependencies was automatically generated using pip freeze and pipreqs to capture the exact versions of all Python packages installed during development. To replicate the development environment exactly, a new team member would need to follow these steps: 1) git clone <repository> to get a local copy of the project 2) pip install invoke to install the task runner we use for automating setup commands 3) invoke create_environment to create the Conda env and then run invoke requirements plus invoke dev_requirements to install requirements.txt and the dev tools with pinned versions 4) invoke gcloud, which runs gcloud auth application-default login to authenticate with Google Cloud Platform and grant the necessary permissions to access the dtu_mlops project. After completing these steps, the new team member will have a fully functional development environment with all dependencies installed and properly configured, including access to cloud resources needed for the project. For extra reproducibility we include a Dev Container (Python 3.12-slim) that installs the same requirements, and Dockerfiles for backend/frontend/train images to pin runtime dependencies in deployment environments.

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

>Compared to the cookiecutter template, we kept the same high-level folders (src, tests, configs, dockerfiles, reports, docs) but extended them for our workflow. In src/mlops_g116 we added a unified main.py that runs training, evaluation, and visualization in one Hydra-driven run, plus parallel boilerplate variants (train_boilerplate.py, model_boilerplate.py) for experiments. We introduced data_importfromcloud.py to preprocess directly from GCS when a DVC pull is not desired, while still keeping the local data pipeline. We expanded configs with dataset/model/optimizer/training subfolders plus evaluation/visualization, a vertex/ section for cloud training, and cloudbuild.yaml for Docker image builds. For deployment and reproducibility we added several Dockerfiles: main.dockerfile, main.CPU.dockerfile, and main.local.dockerfile for the core pipeline; train.local.dockerfile for local training; plus backend/frontend/evaluate/visualize images, each paired with *_entrypoint.sh scripts. We also added a Dev Container and separate requirements files (runtime, dev, backend, frontend, GPU).

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

>We enforced code quality with Ruff (ruff check) and formatting with ruff format, aligned with PEP8 and run in CI/pre-commit. We also used type hints throughout the Python modules and docstrings  on functions/classes so behavior and inputs are explicit. These practices matter in larger projects because many contributors touch the same code: consistent formatting reduces review noise, linting catches errors and unused code early, and typing makes interfaces clear, enabling tooling and safer refactors. Documentation and docstrings are essential for onboarding and long-term maintenance; they preserve context, make experiments reproducible, and reduce the bus-factor when team members change or revisit the code later.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

>We organized our pytest into subfolders for unit, integration and performance tests. Unit tests validate the core modules (data loading/preprocessing, model shapes, training/evaluation utilities, registry download, and frontend logic) to catch regressions early. Integration tests exercise the FastAPI `/classify` endpoint end-to-end with an in-memory image to confirm the full inference pipeline works. Performance tests (Locust) simulate concurrent users to measure latency and throughput. We also run pytest in GitHub Actions (CI) to ensure tests execute on every push/PR. This setup ensures correctness across components and realistic usage scenarios.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

Our total coverage is 58% (619 misses out of 1479 statements). The low overall number is mainly driven by the large `main.py` (25%) and `train.py` (21%), which include many branches for profiling, logging, cloud uploads, and W&B setup that are hard to exercise in unit tests. Most other modules are above ~75%, with several in the 90% range (backend, frontend, data_importfromcloud, model, registry_download). We cover all key files, which is valuable even if the aggregate is lower. We generate this with the Invoke task `invoke coverage`. We attempted to upload coverage reports to Codecov, but it was costly/complicated for our setup, so we kept local reports. Even with higher coverage we would not trust the system to be error‑free, since tests reduce risk but cannot cover every runtime or data edge case.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

>We made use of both branches and pull requests (PRs) in our project. Each group member worked on their own branch. On the remote repository, we had four branches (main and three personal branches), while locally each member had two branches (main and their personal branch). When it was time to upload changes, we added, committed, and pushed the personal branch. After GitHub Actions passed all tests, we opened a pull request to merge the personal branch into main. Once the tests passed again, we authorized the merge and pulled main locally. Pull requests helped improve version control by enforcing code reviews and automated testing before any changes were merged into the main branch. This ensured that new features or fixes were validated, reduced the risk of introducing errors, and maintained a clear and traceable history of changes. This workflow allowed us to resolve issues without affecting the protected main branch.


### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:


*We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*

> Answer:

>*Yes, we used DVC to manage the data in our project. DVC allowed us to version control large datasets without storing them directly in Git, which would have been inefficient given the size of the data. By storing the raw dataset in a cloud storage bucket and tracking it through DVC, we maintained a reproducible link between versions of the data and the corresponding code. This improved the reliability of the project, as each experiment or model could be traced to the exact dataset used. DVC enabled efficient collaboration among team members by allowing quick and consistent data synchronization using commands such as -dvc pull-. This ensured that all contributors worked with the same data version, reduced inconsistencies across environments, and simplified the setup process when cloning the repository. In containers (Docker/Cloud Run) we avoided dvc push because it requires git metadata and adding `.dvc` files, which is brittle/inefficient inside images. For non data folders like `outputs/` (run artifacts already stored in the bucket) we used direct GCS uploads instead. Locally we used personal credentials, while CI/containers used a service account to grant least privilege access to the bucket; this was essential to automate pulls/uploads and avoid manual logins.*


### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

> Our CI lives in `.github/workflows/` with two pipelines. `tests.yaml` runs on every push/PR and uses a matrix over Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS to catch OS-specific issues. It sets up Python 3.12 (matching our project requirement) and enables pip caching via `actions/setup-python` (keyed on `requirements.txt`, `requirements_dev.txt`, and `pyproject.toml`) to speed up repeat runs. The job installs dependencies, performs an editable install of the package, and runs `pytest tests/`. It also authenticates to GCP when the service‑account secret is present and conditionally performs a `dvc pull`, so integration tests can run with real data while still succeeding on forks where secrets are missing. We set `fail-fast: false` to surface all OS failures in one run. `linting.yaml` is a separate job that installs dependencies and runs `ruff check` plus `ruff format --check` to enforce linting and formatting. We keep a Dependabot config for automated dependency update PRs and a pre-commit config for local checks before pushing. We considered a Python-version matrix, but several dependencies are pinned for 3.12, so we aligned CI with our runtime to avoid incompatibilities. We also tie CI to our branching policy: feature branches must pass these checks before opening a PR to main, keeping the protected default branch stable. Overall, the CI focuses on fast feedback, reproducible installs, and cross‑platform robustness.

## Working in the cloud

> In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.

### Question 17

> **List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

> We used the following Google Cloud services: Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, Cloud Run, Compute Engine, Vertex AI and Cloud Storage (Bucket). Cloud Build handles building Docker images whenever a trigger occurs and pushes them to Artifact Registry, where the containers are securely stored. Cloud Run then deploys and runs these containers, making the application publicly accessible. Compute Engine and Vertex AI are used to train our machine learning models, leveraging CPU resources to increase training speed. Finally, Cloud Storage (Bucket) is used to store the dataset in the cloud, ensuring easy access, version control and scalability. Together, these services provide a fully automated, efficient, and reliable pipeline for building, deploying and training our application in the cloud.

### Question 18

> **The backbone of GCP is the Compute engine. Explained how you made use of this service and what type of VMs**
> **you used?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the compute engine to run our ... . We used instances with the following hardware: ... and we started the*
> *using a custom container: ...*
>
> Answer:

> We used Compute Engine, which is the backbone of Google Cloud Platform, to run virtual machines for training our models. Specifically, we used e2-medium instances with 2 virtual CPUs and 4 GB of memory, running on x86‑64 architecture.We started these virtual machines using a custom container that included all the dependencies and code necessary for our project. This setup allowed us to have a reproducible environment for training, ensuring that all team members could run the same workloads consistently. Compute Engine gave us the flexibility to choose the VM type and resources based on our project requirements and to scale the environment as needed.

### Question 19

> **Insert 1-2 images of your GCP bucket, such that we can see what data you have stored in it.**
> **You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/bucket.png).**
>
> Answer:

### Question 20

> **Upload 1-2 images of your GCP artifact registry, such that we can see the different docker images that you have**
> **stored. You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/registry.png).**
>

> **your project. You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/build.png).**
>
> Answer:

![Cloud Build](figures/build_screenshot.png)


### Question 22

> **Did you manage to train your model in the cloud using either the Engine or Vertex AI? If yes, explain how you did**
> **it. If not, describe why.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We managed to train our model in the cloud using the Engine. We did this by ... . The reason we choose the Engine*
> *was because ...*
>
> Answer:

>We managed to train our model in the cloud using Vertex AI. To do this, we created an actionable trigger (vertex_ai_train.yaml) that could be executed manually from Google Cloud Build. Once the container was pushed to the Artifact Registry, we started training our model. We chose Vertex AI over using a Compute Engine because Vertex AI provides a higher-level, managed environment specifically designed for machine learning workflows. It simplifies tasks such as resource provisioning, scaling, experiment tracking and monitoring. Unlike Compute Engine, where we would have had to manually configure virtual machines, install dependencies, and manage GPU resources, Vertex AI allowed us to train models quickly and reliably with minimal setup. This made the training process faster, less error-prone, and easier to reproduce, which was particularly beneficial for our team workflow.

## Deployment

### Question 23

> **Did you manage to write an API for your model? If yes, explain how you did it and if you did anything special. If**
> **not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did manage to write an API for our model. We used FastAPI to do this. We did this by ... . We also added ...*
> *to the API to make it more ...*
>
> Answer:

We developed an API for our model using FastAPI. The API consists of a root endpoint to test if the service is running and a /classify endpoint that takes in an image and returns the predictions of the best-performing trained model saved in models/model.pth. We implemented an asynchronous lifespan context manager (app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)) to optimize the API's efficiency. This architectural pattern decouples the resource-heavy initialization logic (loading the model) from the request processing logic. Without this, the server would potentially reload the model weights from the disk for every incoming request, causing high latency. By using lifespan, we ensure the model is loaded into memory exactly once when the server starts up.


### Question 24

> **Did you manage to deploy your API, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and**
> **preferably how you invoke your deployed service?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For deployment we wrapped our model into application using ... . We first tried locally serving the model, which*
> *worked. Afterwards we deployed it in the cloud, using ... . To invoke the service an user would call*
> *`curl -X POST -F "file=@file.json"<weburl>`*
>
> Answer:

> We successfully deployed our API both locally (running it via the command line and containerized with docker run) and in the cloud using Google Cloud Run. To deploy to the cloud, we created a Dockerfile (backend.dockerfile) that sets up the necessary environment and dependencies. After building the Docker image, we tagged and pushed it to Google Cloud Artifact Registry. Then, we deployed the image to Cloud Run, configuring the service with unauthenticated access and assigning it sufficient memory resources (2GB). Cloud Run automatically provided a public URL for our API. To invoke the deployed API, you can run the following command: `curl -X POST "https://backend-277552599633.europe-west1.run.app/classify/"   -H "accept: application/json"   -F "file=@path_to_image.jpg;type=image/jpeg"`. Additonally, we set up continuous deployment using Google Cloud Build with the `cloudbuild.yaml`, which automatically builds and deploys the Docker image whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of our GitHub repository.

### Question 25

> **Did you perform any unit testing and load testing of your API? If yes, explain how you did it and what results for**
> **the load testing did you get. If not, explain how you would do it.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For unit testing we used ... and for load testing we used ... . The results of the load testing showed that ...*
> *before the service crashed.*
>
> Answer:

>We implemented integration tests with Pytest that test how different components (FastAPI, PyTorch model, file handling) work together in the API. The tests verify the API is alive and reachable and validate the full machine learning inference pipeline: they confirm the loading of the PyTorch model, weights, and transforms into memory without crashing, test if the API accepts standard file uploads, verify that the model actually runs on the input and produces an output, and check that the output JSON contains the correct keys and returns exactly 4 classes. For load testing, we created a locustfile that simulates sending POST requests with image files to the /classify endpoint. We tested three scenarios: 1, 5, and 20 concurrent users. While performance remained stable at 1 and 5 users with no latency degradation, at 20 users, the system reached 7.0 RPS and began failing (significantly increased latency). In conclusion, our current Cloud Run deployment (1 CPU, 2GB RAM) supports relatively low traffic volumes. To increase capacity, we could increase the number of CPUs assigned to the service and, consequently, the number of workers running the API to utilize those CPUs.


### Question 26

> **Did you manage to implement monitoring of your deployed model? If yes, explain how it works. If not, explain how**
> **monitoring would help the longevity of your application.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.

> We did not manage to implement monitoring for our deployed model. However, implementing monitoring would be important for ensuring the reliability of our application. Monitoring would allow us to track key performance metrics such as response times, error rates, and system resource usage (CPU, memory). These metrics would help us identify potential bottlenecks or failures in the system. For our project, target drift is a more practical strategy than data drift. While detecting drift in images requires complex, resource-heavy feature extraction, target drift simply analyzes the model's outputs. Any significant shift in the distribution of predicted classes could serve as an indicator of potential model failure.

> Answer:

> In total, we used kr130 out of kr8,237 available for our project. The most expensive service was Container Registry Vulnerability Scanning, which cost kr104, followed by Vertex AI and Cloud Run, each costing kr6, and Compute Engine and Artifact Registry, each costing kr4. Overall, working in the cloud was a very positive experience. It provided scalability, flexibility, and easy access to powerful computing resources without the need to maintain physical hardware. Services like Vertex AI and Cloud Run simplified deployment, automated resource management and allowed us to focus on developing and testing our model rather than managing infrastructure. However, there are some drawbacks. Cloud costs can increase quickly if resources are not managed carefully and understanding all the services and their configurations can be overwhelming at first. Despite these challenges, the advantages of speed, reproducibility, collaboration and low maintenance made cloud computing an excellent choice for our project.

### Question 28

> **Did you implement anything extra in your project that is not covered by other questions? Maybe you implemented**
> **a frontend for your API, use extra version control features, a drift detection service, a kubernetes cluster etc.**
> **If yes, explain what you did and why.**

> Example:
> *We implemented a frontend for our API. We did this because we wanted to show the user ... . The frontend was*
> *implemented using ...*
>
> Answer:

> We implemented a frontend for our API using Streamlit. The frontend allows users to easily upload images and view the model's predictions in a user-friendly interface.  Users can upload an image, and upon submission, the frontend sends the image to the backend API (classify endpoint) for classification. The predictions are then displayed on the same page, providing immediate feedback to the user. The frontend is also containerized and deployed in Google Cloud Run and is publicly accessible in https://frontend-277552599633.europe-west1.run.app.

![Pipeline](figures/pipeline.png)

> We have implemented a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using a cloudbuild.yaml configuration file, designed to streamline the process of building, testing and deploying our application. Whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of our GitHub repository, the pipeline is automatically triggered. The Cloud Build service then takes over, building the Docker images for both the backend and frontend, and pushing them to Google Cloud Artifact Registry. Once the images are available, they are deployed to Google Cloud Run, making the application publicly accessible to users via a simple web interface.

>The web application allows users to upload MRI brain images and receive real-time feedback regarding their classification. To ensure data integrity and reproducibility, all uploaded files are stored in a Google Cloud Bucket and can also be downloaded locally using DVC, enabling robust version control over the dataset. The data.py script is responsible for processing these images, transforming .jpg files into tensors suitable for model inference and further analysis.

>To simplify the setup of development environments and the management of permissions, we created several helper functions in tasks.py. These functions automate repetitive tasks and reduce the time required for initial configuration, making it easier for team members to get started or maintain the system

>In addition to the Cloud Build pipeline, we have integrated GitHub Actions workflows that run automatically for every push. These workflows execute unit tests, verifying that all components of the application function correctly and ensuring that any new changes do not introduce errors.

>Overall, this CI/CD setup provides a fully automated, end-to-end workflow for deploying a machine learning application. It covers everything from code integration and containerization to deployment and testing, all while ensuring data versioning, reproducibility, and ease of use. This infrastructure allows users to seamlessly interact with the application, upload MRI images and receive immediate, reliable feedback on their classification results.

### Question 30

> Answer:


>One of the main problems was setting up the CI/CD pipeline. We encountered several issues with permissions, authentication and configurations in Google Cloud Build and Cloud Run.
During deployment of frontend and backend services to Cloud Run, we faced challenges related to memory allocation and service accessibility. Initially, the backend service was allocated only 512MB of memory, which proved insufficient for loading the machine learning model, leading to crashes. We resolved this by increasing the memory allocation to 2GB, ensuring stable operation.
